# Air Canvas

Tired of listening to Powerpoints remotely?
Finding new ways to communicate effectively through digital media?
Want to create a fun and interactive learning environment?

Try out the Air Canvas!!!
You can use any object with a colored tip (e.g. defaulting using a blue expo marker) as a stylus. 

## Getting Started

### Installing

Download this repository by clicking the green button on the upper right corner

or

```

### Running

For macOS users,
a terminal will pop up and ask for your password for sudo, 
because keyboard tracking requires multi-threading.
